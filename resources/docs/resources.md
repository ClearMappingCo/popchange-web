This webpage contains a list of additional resources for the PopChange project. The project is an open project, with as much open source technology used as possible. All the relevant scripts for this project are available in GitHub, outlined below. If you have comments or suggestions on this, please send us these through the Feedback tab above. 

###Research Project

The PopChange website is the public facing part of a research project lead by [Prof. Chris Lloyd](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/christopher-lloyd/) at University of Liverpool. The [project website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/popchange/introduction/) contains more information on the research project including current research papers. 

###Policy Briefings
The PopChange team is writing a series of short (four page) policy briefings which summarise research which has been undertaken as a part of the project. Additional briefings will be added in the coming months; themes of planned briefings include deprivation change in Britain, and country of birth and ethnicity.

###Grid Generation Process and R Script

The process of generating the grids from the original census geographies (output areas or enumeration districts) are documented on the project website. The R scripts for this are at [https://github.com/nickbearman/popchange](https://github.com/nickbearman/popchange) with inline comments outlining the process. 

###Academic Reference

The approach to creation of the population surfaces is detailed [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/schoolofenvironmentalsciences/geography/research/popchange/PopulationSurfaces.pdf). When using the PopChange population surfaces in publications please cite this document as follows:

###PopChange Web Resource

This website ([http://popchange.liverpool.ac.uk](http://popchange.liverpool.ac.uk)) was developed using a range of open resources and the source code is available at [https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-web](https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-web). 

###Using the PopChange Resource

A range of practical workbooks are being developed to show users how to get the most from the resource. These are available at [https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-documentation](https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-documentation). 

If you wish to do more comprehensive analysis on the data than is possible on the website, we would recommend you download QGIS from [http://www.qgis.org](http://www.qgis.org). You can download the GIS data files from the Data section of the website and some instructions on using these in QGIS are provided in the practical workbooks.
