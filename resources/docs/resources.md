This webpage contains a list of additional resources for the PopChange project. The project is an open project, with as much open source technology used as possible. All the relevant scripts for this project are available in GitHub, outlined below. If you have comments or suggestions on this, please send us these through the Feedback tab above. 

###Research Project

The PopChange website is the public facing part of a research project lead by [Prof. Chris Lloyd](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/christopher-lloyd/) at University of Liverpool. The [project website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/popchange/introduction/) contains more information on the research project including current research papers. 

###Grid Generation Process and R Script

The process of generating the grids from the original census geographies (output areas or enumeration districts) are documented on the project website. The R scripts for this are at [https://github.com/nickbearman/popchange](https://github.com/nickbearman/popchange) with inline comments outlining the process. 

###Academic Reference

The approach to creation of the population surfaces is detailed [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/schoolofenvironmentalsciences/geography/research/popchange/PopulationSurfaces.pdf). When using the PopChange population surfaces in publications please cite this document as follows:

This document will be replaced with a journal article in due course – please check the PopChange website for updates to the core project publications.

###PopChange Web Resource

This website (http://popchange.liverpool.ac.uk) was developed using a range of open resources and the source code is available soon at [https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-web](https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-web). 

###Using the PopChange Resource

A range of practical workbooks are being developed to show users how to get the most from the resource. These are available at [https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-documentation](https://github.com/ClearMappingCo/popchange-documentation). 

If you wish to do more comprehensive analysis on the data than is possible on the website, we would recommend you download QGIS from [http://www.qgis.org](http://www.qgis.org). You can download the GIS data files from the Data section of the website and some instructions on using these in QGIS are provided in the practical workbooks. 

###Acknowledgements

PopChange is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the Secondary Data Analysis Initiative (SDAI), Phase 2 (project ES/L014769/1) and this support is acknowledged gratefully. The Office for National Statistics are project partners. The research builds on the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grant Scheme funded project ‘Generating population surfaces for England and Wales using information on landuse and the spatial structure of population variables’ (SG121849), which ran from 2013 to 2014. 

The project is based with the University of Liverpool’s cross-disciplinary Centre for Spatial Demographics Research.
